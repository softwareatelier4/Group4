# JobAdvisor Application
A sort of super-simple README.

## Development
Steps for a nice development:
  - Follow [AdonisJS docs](http://adonisjs.com/docs/3.2/overview) when writing code
    - Remember that AdonisJS make use of ES6/7 (yield, generators and other beautiful things!)
  - Discuss any doubt with other team members
  - Write tests for what you've done
    - Check them by running `$> npm run test -- <your tests files>`
    - Check for the coverage `$> npm run coverage -- <your tests files>`
  - **Lint** your code before submitting!
    - We use [StandardJS](http://standardjs.com/) as AdonisJS does
    - You can either lint by running `$> npm run lint` 
    - Or setting up your editor to live have feedback (eg. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) -> [plugin](https://github.com/shinnn/vscode-standard))
  - Write cleaner and understandable commit message
    - First line must be not longer than 50 chars 
    - Or it should be a general description to the changes you've made
    - Yes, you can and should do commit with multiple lines!
